============

Contains code for an iOS consumer electronics shopping app that I built. The backend Java code is my other repo: roy-manzi-74. The central idea behind the application was to allow users to search for products using "qualitative" queries. This idea came to me when my sister one day asked me to buy her a laptop that was "small and can fit in my handbag" and my girlfriend asked me for a "small, cute phone". The goal of the app was to enable non-technical people search for electronics products using qualitative search terms like "small, fast, attractive, light, etc."

ManziaShoppingUI Project:

1- pulls product data from the backend JavaEE server
2- allows users to generate qualitative queries using UIPickerView
3- displays top-ranked products for the qualitative query
4- displays a chart that shows the rank of the product against each selected qualitative attribute
